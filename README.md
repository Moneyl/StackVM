# Stack based VM
Stack based VM written in [Beef](https://www.beeflang.org/). For fun/learning purposes.

## Syntax
- Common arithmetic operators (-, +, *, /) including unary -.
- Parentheses for precedence control.

## Sources
The design and implementation of the VM is based on the second half of [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). It's not intended to be a perfect recreation of clox so it may vary in areas.
